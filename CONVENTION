==== CODING CONVENTIONS ====

=== Header files
Header files shall use the extension .h

Include guards shall be formatted in the following way:
	#ifndef SLC_MODULE_FILE_H
	#define SLC_MODULE_FILE_H
	<code>
	#endif
where
	MODULE is the module the header belongs to in all-caps and
	FILE is the filename of the header without the extension .h in all-caps

Forward declarations shall be placed in their own header files.
(A header like this will later be called 'header_fwd')
The headers shall be named as follows:
	header_fwd.h
where
	header is the filename of the header without the extension .h
Headers for inline functions and templated classes are special cases.
They will be discussed later.

Inline files are used for special cases such as templated classes.
Inline file is an implementation file included in a header.
This is because it allows definition 'outside' the header file
for member functions of templated classes and implementations
for inline functions in a very similar way.
Inline files shall use the extension .inl
If an inline file is included in a header, the header_fwd for that
header shall only contain an include statement to include the
actual header.
